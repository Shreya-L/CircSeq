## CircSeq RNA Pipeline

# Purpose

Circular RNA or circRNAs, are non-coding RNAs that form covalent closed ring structures that protect these molecules from exonuclease degradation - making them very stable. circRNAs have been implicated in diseases such as diabetes, chronic inflammatory diseases, aging and cancer. We aim to assess the role circRNAs may play in high grade astrocytomas.
